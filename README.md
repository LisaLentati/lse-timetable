## LSE lectures & seminars timetable

The LSE lectures and seminars timetable is structured so that each course has its own page, as you can see [here](https://www.lse.ac.uk/school/timetables/lecture_seminar_timetable.htm) for the academic year 2020/2021.

The Jupyter Notebook contains
- a function which reads the timetables for each course and puts them together into a dataframe,
- examples on how to use the dataframe.
